**`FastAPI Proxy Rotator Project Overview`**

This project demonstrates how to build a FastAPI application that implements proxy rotation. Proxy rotation involves changing the proxy server used for incoming requests at regular intervals. This project is set up using Gunicorn as the ASGI server and Nginx as a reverse proxy.

`Project Logic`

    The application uses a proxy rotation mechanism that switches the proxy server every 10 minutes. This rotation is achieved by maintaining a list of proxy servers and switching between them based on a timer.

`Project Requirements`
- Python 3.7+:
    The project requires Python 3.7 or a higher version to run the FastAPI application.
- Virtual Environment (Optional):
    Using a virtual environment is recommended to manage dependencies and isolate the project environment.
- Nginx:
    Nginx is used as a reverse proxy to handle incoming traffic and route requests to the FastAPI application.
- Gunicorn:
    Gunicorn serves as the ASGI server to run the FastAPI application.
- FastAPI:
    The FastAPI framework is used to build the proxy rotator application.
- Proxy Servers:
    list of proxy server addresses that will be rotated.

`Proxy Rotation Logic Implementation` 

The proxy rotation logic is implemented using a ProxyRotator class that maintains a list of proxy servers.
The class switches between proxy servers at regular intervals (10 minutes in this case).
A background thread handles the proxy rotation, ensuring that the server continuously rotates proxies.

`Conclusion`

This project showcases how to implement proxy rotation within a FastAPI application using Gunicorn and Nginx. By following the provided logic and setup instructions, you can create a functional proxy rotator application that changes proxy servers at regular intervals.
